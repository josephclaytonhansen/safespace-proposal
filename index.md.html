                          **SafeSpace**
   SafeSpace - A project proposal to help vulnerable people escape dangerous situations
   By [Joseph Hansen](mailto:josephclaytonhansen@gmail.com)

This is a high-level overview of the proposal, omitting technical details in favor of a general discussion of problems, solutions, rationale, structure, and project goals. As this project is currently in the ideation phase, technical details and organizational specifics are not currently planned or relevant. 




The Need for an Escape Route
==============================================================

People in abusive situations often have a *desire* to escape and find better circumstances, but may feel they lack the power or ability to do so.
The abuser could range from a partner to a parent, but generally speaking, a common trait among abusers is exercising control over 
their victim and creating a sense of danger should the victim attempt to free themselves from this control. 

Victims in abusive situations are often able to significantly improve their lives once they can remove themselves-
both physically and mentally- from the direct control of their abuser. 

The difficulties of escaping
---------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, there are common obstacles towards this important step. These include: 
* The abuser asserts physical control over the victim's keys, credit cards, or other posessions that would allow for a physical escape 
* The abuser monitors texts or other messages on the victim's phone or computer
* The abuser asserts control over the victim's finances 
* The abuser uses personal details of the victim to follow, monitor, and control them


SafeSpace: a vision for a safe escape route
==============================================================

Given the difficulties mentioned, the need for a solution that allows victims to escape a dangerous situation without putting themselves
in increased peril is obvious. I propose SafeSpace as a new framework to help these victims. 

<br/>
 <big>SafeSpace is a non-profit group that uses an automated system to arrange transport and secure a safe location for people in need- discreetly, freely, safely, and quickly.</big>

 ## A fictional example of how SafeSpace works
 1. Ashley is living with an emotionally abusive and controlling partner who limits their access to finances and transportation. 
 2. One day, this abuse escalates to physical, and Ashley finds herself fearing for her life. She wants to leave, immediately, so she can get to a hospital for her injuries. Her partner controls her keys and will not allow her to leave. She is unwilling to call the police or call a friend for help, as her partner is close by and would overhear the call, endangering her further. 
 3. Ashley does have access to a tablet. When her partner is distracted by something on television, Ashley is able to pull up the SafeSpace website, click an "I need help now" button, and close the website in a matter of seconds. Before she closes the website, she is notified by the site that transportation will be at her location at a certain point- in this case, 45 minutes from now, and told a secret 4-digit PIN she can use to verify the lodging and transportation. In this case, 8201. 
 4. The SafeSpace application uses her location and an automatic alogorithim to:
    * Find a community shelter, participating hotel or motel, or other safe source of lodging
    * Book a room for Ashley (if the best source available is a hotel/motel) under a pseudonym, and pays for a 24 hour stay. In this fictional example, SafeSpace books a room at a nearby participating hotel.
    * Seperately notify the staff of this lodging, letting them know that this is a SafeSpace person.
    * Find the best source of transportation- either a bus or similar service within walking distance, or a driving service such as Uber or a taxi. In this fictional example, SafeSpace books and pays for an Uber.
  5. The transportation (in this case, an Uber) arrives at the scheduled time. When Ashley's partner is not in the room, she sneaks out of their apartment.
  6. Rather than giving the Uber driver her name, Ashley asks the driver for the 4 digit pin. The driver tells her the pin- 8201- and Ashley knows it's safe to take this Uber.
  7. Ashley arrives at the motel, checking in with her 4 digit pin. She is now safe- she has a place to sleep for the night, away from her abuser, and her abuser does not know where she is or how to find her. 

 Countering the obstacles to safety
 -----------------------------------
 The obstacles listed above must each be countered in order for this project to be successful. I propose the following counters to each obstacle: 
 * SafeSpace uses public transportation or driving services such as Uber, taxis, or Lyft. The victim does not need access to keys or a vehicle.
 * SafeSpace can be summoned immediately, at any time, from a text, email, or the web applcation. As the process is automated, there is no need for highly dangerous human interaction such as a phone call. This also means "tracks" from SafeSpace are easy to hide and delete.
 * SafeSpace provides free transport and a free place to sleep/stay for 24 hours. The victim is not required to have any financial involvement. 
 * SafeSpace books transportation and lodging with trusted partners, trained in safety protocols, and uses pseudonyms for the victim. This prevents the abuser from having access to the victim. 

Project Overview
=================
There are two major components to SafeSpace- the *organization* and the *application*.

Application
-----------
### Function
SafeSpace performs the following functions each time it is used: 
* Determines the user's location
* Finds transportation and lodging options in the user's area
* Finds a cheap, optimal combination of transportation and lodging and books it 
* Generates a unique 4-digit PIN provided *only* to the user, the lodging staff, and the transportation staff
* Shares relevant information with the user and mentioned staffs 

### Access
To be effective, SafeSpace must be easily and immediately accessible, with no human interaction and no wait times. SafeSpace is accessible via text, email, or a dedicated website. A website should be the main option, as email or text will require the user to receive a notification, which may be monitored or detected by the abuser. However, for circumstances where a website is not viable, SafeSpace must have an automated email and text system. 

Organization
-------------

### Structure
It is, at this early stage of ideation, unclear the structure this organization should take. In broad strokes, it would be necessary to have a team dedicated to marketing and awareness, a team dedicated to grants and fundraising, a team dedicated to partnerships, a team dedicated to research and impact monitoring, and a development team maintaining and improving the application.

There will almost certainly be overlap between these teams, and many of these "teams" encompass functions that could be performed by one person. For instance, it is my intention to develop and maintain the application of SafeSpace myself, at least for the foreseeable future before a larger expansion.

As with all non-profit projects, SafeSpace must have a small, passionate, team. 

### Awareness
SafeSpace will require widespread public awareness through marketing and other awareness methods. Like any service, SafeSpace is pointless without users. 

### Legal and government liasons
There are many complexities involved, especially in regions where local government may be hostile to non-profits or abuse intervention efforts. SafeSpace errs on the side of caution- if SafeSpace is met with displeasure by local, disgruntled, officials, SafeSpace should leave that region. 

If SafeSpace becomes a larger organization, it may someday have the resources to address these challenges- as a small project, however, it is not worth attempting to win these kinds of fights.

As a non-profit, finances will need to be carefully monitored and handled to ensure compliance with all regulations. 

### Grants
SafeSpace will need large amounts of funding and generate absolutely no income whatsoever, putting it in a highly perilous position of being desirable only to altruistic individuals and organizations. SafeSpace will require near-constant grant writing and applications. 

### Fundraising
SafeSpace will also require near-constant fundraising and networking with altruistic individuals. 

### Partnerships
SafeSpace will be more effective if certain motel chains, transportation services, etc, are willing to form a partnership with SafeSpace. This partnership is mutually beneficial- the partner can provide services at a reduced cost for SafeSpace users, which should be infrequent enough that it has no effect on their overall revenue. (For example, a motel chain partnered with SafeSpace could donate a night once a month for SafeSpace purposes with no effect on their profit stream.) The partner would gain charitable tax writeoffs and excellent publicity. Partners could advertise themselves as doing good in their community, which will draw in increased business from social-wellness-minded customers.

A partnership team, then, will be crucial for SafeSpace's success. 

### Research and impact monitoring
SafeSpace will need research justifying both the service (i.e., research showing that providing a safe way out of abusive situations is effective) and the use of grants and other income (i.e., research showing that in a specific community affected by a specific grant, specific people's lives have been bettered by SafeSpace).

First Steps
============
SafeSpace should be rolled out gradually, working with one local government and group of businesses at a time. Short and mid-term goals must always be focused on specific regions at the largest.  SafeSpace must demonstrate success on an application and organizational level before expanding- that is to say, SafeSpace needs to consistently work in one city before attempting to implement in two cities. 


Preventing application misuse
==============================
I've considered extensively the potential use case of people in no real need abusing this system to get free transportation or free lodging. After this reflection, I believe this use case will ultimately be rare to the point of being non-existent, for the following reason: 

SafeSpace does not provide free transportation to a destination of a user's choosing. The user has *no* control over where their 24 hours of free lodging are, and SafeSpace will always favor the cheapest possible option. It is highly unlikely that someone not truly in need would want to spend 24 hours in a economy-grade motel or community shelter.


Conclusion
==========
SafeSpace has the potential to transform dangerous situations into chances for growth and success.
